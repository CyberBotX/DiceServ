 * Requires: Anope 2.0.x
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Description:
 *
 * A dice rolling pseudo-client, mainly useful for playing pen & paper RPGs,
 * such as Dungeons and Dragons, over IRC.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Configuration example can be found in diceserv.example.conf.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Changelog:
 *
 * 3.0.4 - Replaced Agner Fog's SFMT+MOA RNG with a dSFMT RNG by the authors
 *           of the Mersenne Twister RNG, mainly due to concerns over the RNG
 *           not producing unbiased results.
 * 3.0.3 - Fixed an issue with user access in a moderated channel.
 *       - Removed unused delimiter argument from my Join() function.
 *       - Fixed an issue with DiceServData's HasExtended() function so it
 *           would properly detect if we have extended results or not.
 *       - Changed logic on determining when to start attempting to get
 *           extended output.
 *       - Fixed some typos and comments.
 * 3.0.2 - Fixed an issue with SET IGNORE's reloading.
 *       - Better handling on determining when to use extended output.
 *       - Replaced usage of OnPostCommand for adding to NickServ/ChanServ
 *           info, used OnNickInfo and OnChanInfo instead.
 *       - Better checks for numbers in Infix to Postfix conversion.
 *       - Prevent factorials of 13 or higher due to limit on 32-bit integers
 *           as well as execution time.
 *       - Prevent potential crashes if a fantasy command other than the D&D
 *           3e Character one is used with no arguments.
 *       - Minor C++11 fixes.
 *       - Other minor code cleanups.
 * 3.0.1 - Fixed issues with loading an old DiceServ database so it actually
 *           works (there was a typo in the configuration file plus a timer
 *           has to be used).
 *       - Made a specialization of stringify for double to correct issues
 *           with some numbers using scientific notation when they shouldn't
 *           have as well as bring the precision back up.
 *       - Fixed EARTHDAWN on *nix-based systems.
 *       - Fixed DND3ECHAR so it actually works.
 * 3.0.0 - Massive rewrite, now only targets Anope 2.0.x and has been heavily
 *           modularized.
 *       - Added support for functions to have an arbitrary number of
 *           arguments, used by only the max and min function currently.
 *       - Better handling of when to switch from long-form extended output to
 *           short-form extended output to no extended output.
 *       - Made sure that the math functions that were added for use with
 *           Visual Studio are only compiled in for Visual Studio 2012 or
 *           earlier, as they were finally included with Visual Studio 2013.
 *       - Completely restructured how results are handled.
 *       - Removed dtoa function as Anope's stringify could be used to replace
 *           it (at the cost of lower output precision on floating-point
 *           values).
 *       - Replaced the Mersenne Twister RNG with a combination RNG of a
 *           SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister RNG and a Mother-of-all RNG.
 *       - Added atan2 math function.
 * 2.0.3 - Fix some memory leaks that went unnoticed by me until recently.
 * 2.0.2 - Fix a crash bug for the Anope 1.8.x versions and a lack of an error
 *           message for the Anope 1.9.x versions caused if there is nothing
 *           before or after the tilde.
 * 2.0.1 - Minor fix of permission in DiceServ's SET command.
 *       - Minor edit of GECOS of DiceServ to use "Service" instead of
 *           "Server".
 *       - Added version for Anope 1.9.5.
 *   2.0 - Replaced Coda's expression parser with a parser of my own that
 *           converts the expression from infix to postfix using the
 *           shunting-yard algorithm and then evaluates it.
 *       - Added support for DnD3e character creation rolls.
 *       - Removed Exalted dice rolls from the service, I'm not 100% sure they
 *           were ever being done right.
 *       - Used enums for the dice roll types and errors for easier usage.
 *       - Fixed overflow checks.
 *       - Allow for d% anywhere in an expression, suggested by Namegduf.
 *       - Split apart parsing the expression and evaluating it, suggested by
 *           Namegduf.
 *       - Better buffer overflow checking, and removed check for the
 *           expression being too long, the current parser can handle long
 *           expressions unlike the last parser (no offense to Coda).
 *       - Added support for the pen & paper RPG Earthdawn, suggested by
 *           DukePyrolator.
 *       - Added support for math functions. (such as sqrt, trunc, cos, etc.)
 *       - Added support for the math constants of e and pi.
 *       - Added a CALC command which is like ROLL but without rounding.
 *       - Added configuration options for DiceServ's pseudo-client name as
 *           well as giving a network-wide ability for channel operators to
 *           set DiceServ channel ignores.
 *       - Added functionality for a shorter extended output if showing the
 *           results of each individual roll would be too long to display.
 *       - Better way of determining when to display the extended output
 *           buffer.
 *       - Utilize the Mersenne Twister RNG (random number generator) instead
 *           of Anope's RNG, it's faster but uses up a bit more memory. As a
 *           result, Coda's algorithm used in the dice roller is not longer
 *           used.
 *       - Added support for dual-argument functions of max(), min, and rand().
 *   1.0 - Initial version (was only part of an Epona 1.4.14 edit).
 *       - Contained expression parser and dice roller algorithms from Adam
 *           Higerd (Coda Highland).

 *   - When a _ is encountered, add the number following it to the postfix notation equation, but make sure it's negative.
 *   - When a number is encountered, add it to the postfix notation equation.
 *   - When a function is encountered, add it to the operator stack and store a 1 on the arity stack.
 *   - When a constant is encountered, convert it to a number and add it to the postfix notation equation.
 *   - When an operator is encountered:
 *     - Check if we had any numbers prior to the operator, and fail if there were none.
 *     - Always add open parentheses to the operator stack.
 *     - When a close parenthesis is encountered, pop all operators until we get to an open parenthesis or the stack becomes
 *       empty, failing on the latter.
 *     - For all other operators, pop the stack if needed then add the operator to the stack.
 *   - When a comma is encountered, do the same as above for when a close parenthesis is encountered, but also check to make
 *     sure there was a function prior to the open parenthesis (if there is one). Increase the top of the arity stack by one.
 *   - If anything else is encountered, fail as it is an invalid value.
 * - If there were operators left on the operator stack, pop all of them, failing if anything is left on the stack (an open
 *   parenthesis will cause this).
 *
 * Of special note, when a function is being popped from the operator stack, if the function is allowed to take a variable
 * number of arguments, the number of arguments from the arity stack will be appended to the function's name, with an underscore
 * before that. The arity stack will be popped regardless.
 *
 * The improvement to the shunting-yard algorithm to allow functions to have arbitrary numbers of arguments comes from:
 * https://blog.kallisti.net.nz/2008/02/extension-to-the-shunting-yard-algorithm-to-allow-variable-numbers-of-arguments-to-functions/
